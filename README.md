# WhatBytes

A simple django application to showcase authentication and authorization workflows.

To self host the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo and change into the WhatBytes repository: `https://github.com/maxdiplogit/WhatBytes.git`
2. Migrate the database changes using the command: `python3 manage.py migrate`
3. (optional) Create a super user for adding users through the admin panel: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
4. Run the server to use the application: `python3 manage.py runserver`

Hurray!
